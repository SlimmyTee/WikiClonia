In another feature called the low back chain shift, the {{IPA|[\u0254]}} vowel sound of words like ''talk'', ''law'', ''cross'', ''chocolate'', and ''coffee'' and the often [[homophonous]] {{IPA|[\u0254r]}} in ''core'' and ''more'' are tensed and usually raised more than in [[General American]] English. In the most old-fashioned and extreme versions of the New York dialect, the vowel sounds of words like \"girl\" and of words like \"oil\" became a diphthong {{IPA|[\u025c\u026a]}}. This is often misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the ''er'' and ''oy'' sounds, so that ''girl'' is pronounced \"goil\" and ''oil'' is pronounced \"erl\"; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like \"Joizey\" (Jersey), \"Toidy-Toid Street\" (33rd St.) and \"terlet\" (toilet).&lt;ref name=NYT19930214/&gt; The character [[Archie Bunker]] from the 1970s [[sitcom|television sitcom]] ''[[All in the Family]]'' was an example of having used this pattern of speech.\n\nThe classic version of the New York City dialect is generally centered on [[middle class|middle]] and working-class New Yorkers.
